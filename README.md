This repository holds the basic implementation of a RNN.

It is based on the blog post [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) from Andrej Karpathy

The code is basically a transcript from his [gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086).

I also got some help from Daniel Whitenack's [Building a Neural Net from Scratch in Go](http://www.datadan.io/building-a-neural-net-from-scratch-in-go/)
